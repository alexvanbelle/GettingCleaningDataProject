GettingCleaningDataProject
==========================

This is the repository for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data. 

It contains:
* README.md => this file
* CodeBook.md => description of the fields of the tidy data set
* run_analysis.R => script that is able to generate the tidy data set
* step5_tidy.txt => the tidy data set generated by the script

### Original raw data set:
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

### Processing done to tie the data
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Use the right column names by using the value provided in features.txt
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names by joining with the activity_labels.txt
* Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Average is computed with the standard mean function and each column is renamed to reflect this processing (meanOf.<NameOfOriginalVariable>).
